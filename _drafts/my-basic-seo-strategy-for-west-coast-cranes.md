When I was approached by a client to not only build a website but to rank high on google for a particular search term, it proved to be a case of getting back to basics in terms of SEO.

With [wccranes.ca](wccranes.ca) there were some basics steps that I had to complete to get the site optimized for the local market that the client was looking to attract.

Here are some of the basics steps that I took to make that happen.  

It was important that I take SEO into consideration __during__ the web development process rather than it be an afterthought. With this mindset from the beginning I started in somewhat unusual fashion for a development project with vital keyword research.  

## Keyword Research

Google's keyword planner was my first port of call. This was a crucial stage in not only the SEO process but the development of the site as a whole. If research on keywords was skipped, it would have led to an approach that did not put content first. Luckily I was able to persuade the client that this research would return quick results when it came to getting his business noticed after having no online presence prior to this experience.

After initial conversations with the client it was clear that sites were ranking high on the term "overhead cranes" that didn't actually compete in this market whereas my client was aiming to be the go to person on Vancouver Island for this type of business. What this told us was that with the correct content we could make significant gains in organic search rankings if we targeted this phrase throughout the development process.

## Title Tags and meta description

With the initial research complete it allowed a smoother transition to the content that would define the site in terms of SEO. Following the guidelines here at [SEO Moz](https://moz.com/learn/seo/meta-description) I was able to come up with a concise and clear meta description related to the service that West Coast Cranes would provide with a locational twist.

The meta description is as follows:

> West Coast Cranes is Vancouver Island's #1 overhead crane company. We provide training, parts and inspections 24/7. We also offer monthly sales to local companies across British Columbia.

The main focus here was to include the identified term of "overhead cranes" as well as the location of the company to attract the correct visitors to the site.

The go to tool for Wordpress and SEO is the [Yoast SEO plugin](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/) which provides a great base for creating unique page titles and descriptions for every page.

## Site structure

With this being West Coast Cranes first personal online presence it was vital that we provided users with navigation that was extremely simple and easy to use. This is where communication with the client became very important. It was imperative that I understand their business which would then allow me to structure the site accordingly so that the user would be guided to the correct information that he/she would require. After all, the main purpose of this project was to attract the right users and prompt them into contacting West Coast Cranes. Simple yet very effective.

## Heading Tags

Usually an overlooked concept in SEO is the appropriate use of heading tags. I implemented this very easily on the 'Services' page where each unique service is placed within a h3 tag which is subsequently underneath the h1 tag that contains the title of the page. This gives google a clear message of the services that West Coast Cranes provides and will lead to a higher organic position.

## Responsive Design (Mobile Optimised)

After the major announcement by Google that mobile optimized sites would make significant gains on mobile search results, a responsive design was paramount to the success of the site. [Mobile Update](http://searchengineland.com/library/google/google-mobile-friendly-update)

A quick search for the site on Google's own [mobile friendly test page](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/) shows that the site matches the requirements needed for optimum performance on mobile devices.  

This is what you want to see:

This will result in a 'Mobile Friendly' tag being positioned before your meta description on search results telling users that your site is optimized and ready to be viewed on a mobile device.

## Some final thoughts

1. Write content for humans and not just googlebot
2. Use a content first approach
3. Establish a content hierarchy
4. Submit an XML Sitemap
5. Create a user friendly 404 page
6. Make use for free tools such as Google Webmaster Tools, Google Analytics and Google Adwords

## Final Thoughts

Now that webmasters are aware that delivering a full responsive content driven experience is vital, the next step is to do this in a responsible manner.
