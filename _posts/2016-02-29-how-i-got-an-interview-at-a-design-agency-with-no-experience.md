title: How I got an interview at a design agency with no experience
excerpt: With my recent decision to change my career, I realised that a different approach to getting noticed was required in the creative industry. When I saw this job title, I knew this was a chance to impress.

When I decided that it was the right time in my life for a change of career, I knew that when I set my heart on the creative industry the way I applied for positions had to change. Surely sending a CV and a cover letter in Microsoft Word documents was not going to cut it anymore. Here is the approach I took to getting that first interview at an agency.

## Let's back up for a bit first

It is important I let you know that I had a very small stint at an e-commerce agency in Vancouver, BC but this was back in 2011 and probably no longer relevant to potential employers. The last 3-4 years of my employment have been in the recoveries industry, a far cry from what I wanted to do since leaving university in 2009.

## The beginning

Create my own online presence. This would give me a space online where I can store my CV, list the skills that I can offer and some recent work that I have completed. On top of this it also gave me the opportunity to learn a new technology when building out the site.
[Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) was my choice. A static site generator which is written in Ruby. It allowed me to become more comfortable with liquid tags, the command line and using Github for version control. Even if no-one visited my site I would still have gained knowledge that would benefit me in the long run. A win win situation.

## Look for the right opportunities

Identify attainable positions based on my lack of experience. First of all, I decided that I would move pretty much anywhere in the UK for the right role. A vast search of agencies in Scotland and the north of England ensued to narrow it down to places that were offering the environment I required in order to advance my career in the correct manner. There was no rocket science behind this approach. Basically I was going to agency websites, seeing if they had a career page and if so then determining if my skills matched one of their roles on offer.

## Make initial contact

When I identified one particular role, which was admittedly, out with my level of experience I decided to take a shot.

Here was my opening email to the prospective employer.

The 'casual' or colloquial tone is completely deliberate as I felt it would help me come across as a human being in this ever expanding digital world.

> Dear *** Creative,

> Since you have 'creative' in your company name I think I need to do something 'creative' to get noticed, so here goes.
Check out my website www.craigengland.co.uk

> I believe attaching a CV to my email is too easy (and old school!) so why not go download it from my site. There is even a strategically placed 'call to action' to lure you too it!

> My work with the Greater Victoria Coalition to End Homelessness was voluntary but purely based on starting the social media strategy for this important charitable organisation. I wouldn't call myself a 'guru' in social media but I think I have the capability and drive to succeed in this role.

> If this appeals to your creative side then feel free to give me a call or send me an email. (Even if it doesn't you can still do either of those things!)

> Thanks for reading.

> Regards,

> Craig England

After two hours I received a response which verified that my strategy for applying for positions was beginning to work.

Here was the response.

> Hi Craig

> Thanks for your enquiry.

> Where I can see that you don’t have the direct experience we are looking for, you do have knowledge in several areas of the design industry. I was also impressed with your style of communication and think it would be worthwhile grabbing a coffee and having a chat. Let me know when you’re available next week to pop in.

> Very best

After receiving this I got to work on preparing for the interview which also involved another unique approach. As the person responding specifically said he was impressed with my method of communication, I put together a one page document to show him the process I went through to apply for the role.

I call it my own personal content strategy. You can view it [here](/assets/files/interview-preparation.pdf)

Here is another example. Although I didn't get an interview, I did prompt a response and received some very positive feedback.

> Dear Paul,

> You can find my CV on my personal website, www.craigengland.co.uk.

> Although I have pitched myself as an aspiring digital marketer I came across your job listing and thought that I would make my case for being considered for the position of User Researcher.

> I am going to try something different with regards to this application and attempt to show how my previous experience in collections could be a benefit in this role.

> For the last 3 years, I have been analysing peoples behaviour over the phone in regards to their intentions towards financial stability. This analysis took place on a daily basis and was vital to the reporting that I had to take part in when delivering results to our clients. I believe these skills are directly transferable to user research and being able to develop an understanding of a person's behaviour and how that can have an impact on products.

> As part of this role, I noticed that you are using tools such as Balsamiq and Sketch for wireframing or prototyping. While I have very basic knowledge centered around these programs I have the skills to be able to create mockups directly in HTML and CSS which could have a positive impact on the development process. One idea that I would like to put forward for this sort of work is the creation of a personal pattern library that the company would be able to use for prototyping ideas at the beginning of the life cycle of a design.

> If this has already been done then shame on me for not assuming RKH would haven't of thought of this already! In that case my application is probably null and void!

> Hope you are having a good week.

> Let me know your thoughts and do not hesitate to contact me if you need any further information.

> Regards,

> Craig England

And the response.

> Hi Craig, thanks for the unorthodox email - it makes a change from the
long list of boring badly put together Microsoft Word documents I get
sent :)

> I'm afraid we're not looking for anybody right now, but if you keep your
eye on our Twitter feed, that's likely the first place we'll announce
anything coming up in future.

> Cheers
> Paul

What this told me was that my content strategy was working. I was getting personal responses from directors of companies saying they were impressed with my method of application instead of mail merge replies saying that they would keep my details on file for 3-6 months and that there was nothing available at this time.

## The takeaway

Of course I don't get responses like those all the time but those small emails give me the courage to continue on my ambition of working in the digital industry.

Next step is to land the job! Wish me luck!
