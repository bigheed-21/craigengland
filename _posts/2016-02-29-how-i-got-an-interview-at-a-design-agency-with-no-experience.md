title: How I approach applying for jobs in the creative industry
excerpt: With my recent decision to change my career, I realised that a different approach to getting noticed was required in the creative industry. When I saw this job title, I knew this was a chance to impress.

When I decided that it was the right time in my life for a change of career, I knew that when I set my heart on the creative industry the way I applied for positions had to change. Surely sending a CV and a cover letter in Microsoft Word documents was not going to cut it anymore. Here is the approach I took to getting that first interview at an agency.

## Let's back up for a bit first

When I say no experience, I am sort of bending the truth a little. I had a very small stint at a design agency in Vancouver, BC working for [Jammicron Technology Corporation](http://www.jammicron.com) during the summer of 2011. With this now being 2016 I am considering this 'experience' irrelevant as far as potential employers are concerned. Since that time up until now I was employed in the recoveries industry which was a far cry from what I intended since graduating in 2009.

## The beginning

Create my own online presence. Despite wanting to do this for years, for some reason I never quite completed the task. Now was the time to change that once and for all. This would provide me with an easy outlet for storing my CV, presenting the current skills that I possess and showing off some recent work that I had completed.


## Look for the right opportunities

Here is a list of things that I took into consideration when looking for the right role.

1. Location was not important. I would relocate in a heartbeat.
2. The role had to be part of a design/creative agency.
3. My scope of position would be from business development/sales to junior front end developer.
4. Pay was not important. I realise that I would more than likely start in some sort of entry level or junior position which would result in a drop in wages. Not a concern for me at this stage in my career.
5. Don't apply for every position under the sun. Although I probably don't have this luxury at this time, I felt it was important to apply to companies that I was impressed with. Taking something to 'get by' would defeat the purpose of trying to change career.

## Making contact

When I identified one particular role, which was admittedly, out with my level of experience I decided to take a shot.

Here was my opening email to the prospective employer.

The 'casual' or colloquial tone is completely deliberate as I felt it would help me come across as a human being in this ever expanding digital world.

> Dear *** Creative,

> Since you have 'creative' in your company name I think I need to do something 'creative' to get noticed, so here goes.
Check out my website www.craigengland.co.uk

> I believe attaching a CV to my email is too easy (and old school!) so why not go download it from my site. There is even a strategically placed 'call to action' to lure you too it!

> My work with the Greater Victoria Coalition to End Homelessness was voluntary but purely based on starting the social media strategy for this important charitable organization. I wouldn't call myself a 'guru' in social media but I think I have the capability and drive to succeed in this role.

> If this appeals to your creative side then feel free to give me a call or send me an email. (Even if it doesn't you can still do either of those things!)

> Thanks for reading.

> Regards,

> Craig England

After two hours I received a response which verified that my strategy for applying for positions was beginning to work.

Here was the response.

> Hi Craig

> Thanks for your enquiry.

> Where I can see that you don’t have the direct experience we are looking for, you do have knowledge in several areas of the design industry. I was also impressed with your style of communication and think it would be worthwhile grabbing a coffee and having a chat. Let me know when you’re available next week to pop in.

> Very best

After receiving this I got to work on preparing for the interview which also involved doing something different. As the person responding specifically said he was impressed with my method of communication, I put together a one page document to show him the process I went through to apply for the role.

I call it my own personal content strategy. You can view it [here](/assets/files/interview-preparation.pdf)

Here is another example. Although I didn't get an interview, I did prompt a response and received some very positive feedback.

> Dear Paul,

> You can find my CV on my personal website, www.craigengland.co.uk.

> Although I have pitched myself as an aspiring digital marketer I came across your job listing and thought that I would make my case for being considered for the position of User Researcher.

> I am going to try something different with regards to this application and attempt to show how my previous experience in collections could be a benefit in this role.

> For the last 3 years, I have been analysing peoples behaviour over the phone in regards to their intentions towards financial stability. This analysis took place on a daily basis and was vital to the reporting that I had to take part in when delivering results to our clients. I believe these skills are directly transferable to user research and being able to develop an understanding of a person's behaviour and how that can have an impact on products.

> As part of this role, I noticed that you are using tools such as Balsamiq and Sketch for wireframing or prototyping. While I have very basic knowledge centered around these programs I have the skills to be able to create mockups directly in HTML and CSS which could have a positive impact on the development process. One idea that I would like to put forward for this sort of work is the creation of a personal pattern library that the company would be able to use for prototyping ideas at the beginning of the life cycle of a design.

> If this has already been done then shame on me for not assuming RKH would haven't of thought of this already! In that case my application is probably null and void!

> Hope you are having a good week.

> Let me know your thoughts and do not hesitate to contact me if you need any further information.

> Regards,

> Craig England

And the response.

> Hi Craig, thanks for the unorthodox email - it makes a change from the
long list of boring badly put together Microsoft Word documents I get
sent :)

> I'm afraid we're not looking for anybody right now, but if you keep your
eye on our Twitter feed, that's likely the first place we'll announce
anything coming up in future.

> Cheers
> Paul

What this told me was that my 'content strategy' was working. I was getting personal responses from directors of companies saying they were impressed with my method of application instead of mail merge replies saying that they would keep my details on file for 3-6 months and that there was nothing available at this time.

## The takeaway

Of course I don't get responses like those shown above all the time but those small emails give me the courage to continue on my ambition of working in the digital industry.
