title: My SEO approach to West Coast Cranes
excerpt: With no site audit to perform, as this was a completely new site, it was back to basics for making gains in organic search results

When I was approached by a client to not only build their first ever website but to rank high on google for a particular search term, I came up with an approach of putting content first instead of design and aesthetics.

With [wccranes.ca](http://wccranes.ca) there were some basics steps that I had to complete to get the site optimized for the local market that the client was looking to attract.

This won't be detailing anything groundbreaking in terms of SEO strategy. It will be the minimum that I think should be done for getting a site ready for the potential to rank high on relevant search engines. For this reason it was important that I take SEO into consideration __during__ the web development process rather than it be an afterthought.

## Keyword Research

Google's keyword planner was my first port of call. This was a crucial stage in not only the SEO process but the development of the site as a whole. If research on keywords was skipped, it would have led to an approach that did not put content first. Luckily I was able to persuade the client that this research would return quick results when it came to getting his business noticed after having no online presence prior to this experience.

From this conversation came various 'terms' that the client and I could target throughout different parts of the sites content which would guide the user and search engines to show that the content we were providing was relevant and up to date.

## Content Hierarchy

I believe understanding the clients business is one of the most important aspects of any web related project. Once I established this, the task of structuring the site became a much easier and quicker process.

## Duplicate content

The elephant in the room some may say. This is a problem that SEO's and developers have had ever since the introduction of search engines.

Although this wasn't really an issue during the development of this site, it is important to touch on a few ways on how to handle this situation as it can be detrimental to a sites ranking performance if implemented incorrectly.

1. Because I was using Wordpress as my chosen content management system it was very easy to use the permalinks feature to create consistent and clean URL's to not only benefit the user but to show search engines a logical content hierarchy that we touched upon earlier.
2. The correct use of the canonical link element. A simple yet overlooked step. Make sure from the get go you determine what your 'canonical' page will be. With relation to the West Coast Cranes site, we had http://www.wccranes.ca plus http://wccranes.ca. Using the canonical link element in this case prevents the search engine becoming confused when presented with two different URL's with the same content therefore when we have previously stated our canonical page, the search engine will not determine this as duplicate content which prevents a substantial hit in search engine results.
3. Perform a 301 redirect. If nothing else fails then performing a permanent redirect will overcome this issue of duplicate content by pointing the non-canonical URL's to your preferred version of the same content.


## Title Tags and meta description

With the initial research complete it allowed a smoother transition to the content that would define the site in terms of SEO. Following the guidelines here at [SEO Moz](https://moz.com/learn/seo/meta-description) I was able to come up with a concise and clear meta description related to the service that West Coast Cranes would provide with a locational twist.

The meta description is as follows:

> West Coast Cranes is Vancouver Island's #1 overhead crane company. We provide training, parts and inspections 24/7. We also offer monthly sales to local companies across British Columbia.

The main focus here was to include the identified term of "overhead crane" as well as the location of the company to attract the correct visitors to the site.

Having a unique title for every page is another one of these often overlooked steps but is made really simple with the [Yoast SEO plugin](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/) for Wordpress which gives you an easy to use UI for handling this sort of task. Again, the more simple we make this for humans to navigate, the site will begin to rank well in various search engines.


## Responsive Design (Mobile Optimized)

After the major announcement by Google that mobile optimized sites would make significant gains on mobile search results, a responsive design was paramount to the success of the site. You can read more about this [here](http://searchengineland.com/library/google/google-mobile-friendly-update)

It was my job to make the client understand that building the site with a 'mobile first' philosophy would allow us to determine what was important to the site and disregard items that we deemed irrelevant. After this process it was very easy for me to start designing around content which made the development life cycle much more streamlined.

Google provides you with a very simple way to test if your site is optimized for the mobile landscape. The [mobile friendly test page](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/) allows you to enter your URL and see the results within a few seconds.

This is what you want to see:

This will result in a 'Mobile Friendly' tag being positioned before your meta description on search results telling users that your site is optimized and ready to be viewed on a mobile device.

The benefit to this is that Google will now place a 'mobile friendly' tag next to your meta description like the one you see below.

## The result

West Coast Cranes is ranked number 1 organically on Google, Yahoo and Bing for the search term "overhead cranes vancouver island".

I don't see the site winning any awards for design anytime soon but the original brief from the client was: create a website that will get seen by people who want to use their services. I would say, job done!

## Some final thoughts and extra bits

1. Write content for humans and not just for search engines
2. Use a content first approach
3. Establish a content hierarchy
4. Submit an XML Sitemap
5. Create a user friendly 404 page
6. Make use for free tools such as Google Webmaster Tools, Analytics and Adwords
