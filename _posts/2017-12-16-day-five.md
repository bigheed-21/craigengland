## The Mammoth Day

The plan on the day before was to arrive early so that I could get some proper rest before the longest day of the journey. Throw in the fact that I would start touching some of the highest altitude points on the cycle at the halfway point added to the daunting task of first crossing the border and then tackling 'The Shap', a very infamous long enduring climb in the North of England. Enough of the negativity! I had almost cycled Scotland top to bottom in 4 days!
